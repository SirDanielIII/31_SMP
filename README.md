# 31_SMP (Discontinued)
My personal plugin for the 31 SMP server I've been planning with my friends.

Features: 
1. /ivan - Summons an Ivan (Operators Only)
2. /coords - Coordinate Saves System (4 Slots)
3. /death - Death/Kill Statistics
4. /wand - Overpowered wand
5. /smp - Displays all commands in the plugin

Note:
This plugin disables the use of End Portals (it's not a bug, it's a feature ðŸ˜Œ)
